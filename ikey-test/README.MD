# ikey Application Mock Demo

## Overview

This project is a **mock demo** for the **ikey application**, designed to showcase the user interface and workflow for registering and verifying baseline fundus images in a clinical or research setting.

The demo includes two main HTML pages:

- **register.html** – For registering a new baseline pair of fundus images along with patient and clinic information.
- **ikey.html** – For checking a new pair of images against previously registered data, using identifying information.

Both pages feature a modern, responsive design and interactive image upload functionality.

---

## Features

- **Side-by-side image upload** for left and right eye images (drag-and-drop or file selection)
- **Patient and clinic identification fields**
- **Validation**: At least one identifying field (phone, email, or ID card) is required
- **Reusable CSS and JavaScript** for consistent look and behavior
- **No backend**: This is a front-end mockup only; no data is stored or transmitted

---

## Usage

1. **Open `register.html`** to simulate registering a new patient and their baseline fundus images.
2. **Open `ikey.html`** to simulate checking a new pair of images for changes, using identifying information.

Both pages require you to upload left and right eye images and provide at least one piece of identifying information.

## File Structure

- `register.html` – Registration form for baseline images
- `ikey.html` – Image check form for existing patients
- `register.css` – Shared stylesheet for both pages
- `register.js` – Shared JavaScript for image upload and form validation
